career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    A dynamic and results-focused engineer, who loves shipping delightful products. 
    I flourish in a fast paced environment and am comfortable switching from talking to 
    management at a high level about tradeoffs to reviewing PRs and writing some code! 
    My career thus far has been in highly entrepreneurial environments, granting me the 
    opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects across the domains
    of Web, Mobile, DevOps, data engineering, modeling and analysis, 
    transpilers and dev tooling. 
    Most importantly, I am never complacent, constantly challenging myself to grow as a professional 
    so that I leave everything I touch vastly improved to how I found it.
